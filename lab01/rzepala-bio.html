    <body> 
        Hi, my name is Kathryn Rzepala. I am a current junior studying Applied Data Analytics interested in using data to make informed decisions. At Syracuse University, I am a Leadership and Invest in Success Scholar. I am also involved in Alpha Xi Delta, BeIT, and Women in Technology on campus. Outside of school, I like to read, watch reality TV, dance, and paint. My favorite reality shows are Survivor, Big Brother, and the Traitors, but I enjoy many more. I just recently got into reading in 2025, and have enjoyed the new hobby so far. I’ve read about 20 books since January, my favorites being Normal People by Sally Rooney and Sunrise on the Reaping by Susanne Collins. I hope this short bio helped you to get to know me better!
