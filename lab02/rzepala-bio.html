        <h1>Kathryn's Biography</h1>
        <p>Hi, my name is Kathryn Rzepala. I am a current junior studying <strong>Data Analytics</strong> interested in using data to make informed decisions. At Syracuse University, I am a Leadership and Invest in Success Scholar. I am also involved in Alpha Xi Delta, BeIT, and Women in Technology on campus. </p>
        <h2>Personal Info</h2>
        <p>Outside of school, I like to read, watch reality TV, dance, and paint. My favorite reality shows are Survivor, Big Brother, and the Traitors, but I enjoy many more. I just recently got into reading in 2025, and have enjoyed the new hobby so far. I’ve read about 20 books since January.</p>
        <p>Some of my favorite books are:</p>
        <ul>
           <li>Normal People by Sally Rooney</li> 
           <li>Sunrise on the Reaping by Susanne Collins</li>
           <li>Murder on the Orient Express by Agatha Chirstie</li>
        </ul>
        <p> I hope this short bio helped you to get to know me better! </p>
